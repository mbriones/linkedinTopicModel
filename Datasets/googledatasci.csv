My PhD research was concerned with user models for users in networks with path choice -- both in telecommunications and in transit. At Urban Engines, I am focusing on transit applications. More specifically, I see this area as an example of a multipath network of users trying to greedily maximise commuting experience while sharing common resources -- an applied, dynamic resource allocation problem. The challenging part of this project is that you can only predict the state of the network if your model of user behaviour reflects the way commuters behave in real life. Another major part of my work is the question how to visualise transit data of millions of commuters in an interactive way that is pleasing to the eye, highlights the problems, and allows informed decision making. Here are some questions that I find exciting to think about:-- What is the right way to offer incentives to shift users out of peak time traffic? What is a good mathematical model that reflects commuter behaviour in an incentive program? -- How do commuters behave inside a public transport system and what does their behaviour imply for the system? This is an example of a system that consists of many actors whose behaviour has to be accurately modeled in order to understand the whole system response.  -- How far can we push inferences about the state of the entire system if we have an advanced commuter model?""}; {'title': 'Internship', 'company': 'Nokia', 'date_range': 'Jul 2010 – Dec 2010', 'location': 'Espoo, Finland', 'description': 'At Nokia, I worked with Lars Eggert and Niko Kiukkonen on energy efficient loadbalancing for mobile devices with multiple data interfaces, such as Wifi and 3G/4G/LTE. I was interested in applying the load balancing capabilities of Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and deriving an energy efficient load balancer as a Markov decision problem that takes user behaviour into account. The main ideas are: -- Switching interfaces is costly: Whenever you switch data interfaces, you incur costs for scanning Wifi access points or going to higher energy states for mobile data connections. -- Not switching interfaces can be costly:Whenever data is sent on 3G, the interface goes into a higher energy state and potentially wastes energy when not sending anything after the initial burst. On the other hand, short bursts can be handled with low timeouts and low energy overhead on Wifi.-- Under constant load, some interfaces consume less powers than others:This is not surprising. But how do you make sure that if the user is going to download a large file, you are on the right interface?In general, I came up with a Markov decision problem that described user and interface behaviour. That produced a small state -> action rule table which can be embedded into each phone and updated depending on the usage profile of each user. We had a productive time together, wrote a paper, and handed in a patent:Saving Mobile Device Energy with Multipath TCP, Christopher Pluntke, Lars Eggert, and Niko Kiukkonen, MobiArch 2011Method for Multipath Scheduling Based on a Lookup Table, Christopher Pluntke, NikoKiukkonen, Lars Eggert, patent application, publication date 24/10/2013'}; {'title': 'Internship', 'company': 'Alcatel-Lucent', 'date_range': 'Aug 2009 – Dec 2009', 'location': 'Holmdel, New Jersey', 'description': 'Internship at Bell Labs.

We consider problems where uncertain variables follow distributions that are also unknown. The method attempts to balance the goals of providing a solution that is robust to this distributional ambiguity and effectively leveraging historical data. As in classic distributionally robust optimization, we hedge against distributional ambiguity by optimizing over a worse case distribution that satisfies some constraints. However, instead of using estimates for the moments, we partition the region and estimate conditional moments from historical data in order to derive constraints. Thus we restrict the class of distributions and therefore reduce conservativeness while retaining the advantage over a stochastic program of allowing for distributional ambiguity. As we increase the number of regions in the partition, we include more specific problem data but also have greater estimation errors. We derive a general formulation and demonstrate the computational tractability of the univariate case. In the multivariate case, we explore polygonal and combinations of ellipsoids and differences of ellipsoids partitions. We explore and derive formulations for two major applications: the newsvendor problem and facility location. We perform numerical experiments to evaluate the practical usefulness of conditional moments as compared to full moments and a stochastic approach.'}; {'title': 'Data Science Intern', 'company': 'Allstate', 'date_range': 'May 2015 – Aug 2015', 'location': 'Northbrook, IL', 'description': 'Informed decision making and strategy in agency analytics by using predictive modeling.

For example, consider working on a true/false portion of a test, where you to want to get the answers correct (why else would you be taking a test?) while you\'re put underneath a time constraint - i.e. you need to finish the test in time. Under these conditions, one could imagine that how much time you might take to reach a conclusion could be proportional to how difficult a question is. Thus we can view the accumulation of reasoning that you might take until you reach a decision to effect your reaction time to answering a question; And you could visualize the ""path"" of reasoning that you may have to be straight - i.e. the answer is obvious to you, or the ""path"" may be winding, which may be when the answer is not obvious. All of this intuition basically leads to the diffusion model, which is an analytic model that measures how your cognitive processes in decision making is related to your reaction time. In technical terms, the diffusion model is based off of Markov Chains (each iteration represents a decision making process), where the state is indexed by time, (this is essentially a stochastic process). The steady state for each chain is a decision (either correct or error). The diffusion model reflects both reaction time and accuracy, and therefore is very flexible plenty of data types. Some of my interest stems from this, and the fitting/estimation procedure for the diffusion model.'}; {'title': 'Supervisor', 'company': 'Krannert Center For the Performing Arts', 'date_range': 'Aug 2012 – May 2013', 'location': None, 'description': None}; {'title': 'Technical Specialist', 'company': 'Parkland College', 'date_range': 'May 2011 – Aug 2012', 'location': None, 'description': None}","English","San Francisco Bay Area",NA,NA,"Normal Mixture Models using RSTAN; Classification of Education Data using LDA",NA,"University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign","Big data, small data, blue data, green data and everything in between ... data.

I have worked in various industries, including insurance, agriculture, education, research, and consumer measurement. My workflow typically includes some form of the R and/or Python data science stack, with departures in C/C++, Java, Scala, and associated technologies. I also am a natural born teacher. I have taught both graduate school courses in statistics and corporate training seminars in Pythonic data science methods. One of my joys is witnessing the progression of learning in an individual, and these experiences have helped me learn significant lessons about communicating convoluted information cogently. I've been tremendously lucky to study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign for both my B.S. in Statistics and my M.S. in Statistics. While there I worked as both a Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Adult Learning Lab and Graduate Teaching Assistant for the Lipka Lab.I am excited to be apart of the data science revolution.

I worked with petabyte scale data sets, engineered data pipelines, and carried out analyses in an international collaboration.I applied machine learning techniques in conjunction with custom designed hardware to categorize rare particle events, in order to separate these rare events from a high noise background. I collaborated with a global team of researchers to construct and troubleshoot resistive plate chambers, which were integrated into the PHENIX detector in 2012. I developed and maintained software responsible for the fast production of physics data from raw data using a condor cluster during the subsequent 2012 and 2013 physics data periods at PHENIX using the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. I identified and patched several software performance bottlenecks as part of this work. I also engineered the software systems responsible for monitoring the proton-spin polarization of our colliding beams - a task which was crucial to maintaining data usability and quality.My thesis research focused on understanding the Quantum Chromodynamic origin of the proton spin. I studied the fraction of total proton spin contributed by sea-quarks via colliding polarized protons at 510 GeV center of mass energy in the electroweak decay channel. I studied the W boson decay produced in these collisions, to gain direct access to the helicity distribution sea-quarks, which in turn, provided a window into anti-quark contribution to proton spin.I facilitated the extraction of this result from the 2013 data set, partaking in all phases of the analysis, including hardware testing and implementation, online data production management, and offline data analysis and quality assurance testing.'}; {'title': 'Data Science Fellow', 'company': 'Insight Data Science', 'date_range': 'Jan 2016 – Apr 2016', 'location': None, 'description': 'I built the web application, www.aletrailbeers.com, which guided users to new beers and breweries using machine learning to classify and represent the flavors in beer graphically.

At end of this process, the stabilized biomass presents high levels of nutrients, which can be used both as biofertilizers in agriculture and for the biodegradation of contaminants in the soil through improvement of microbiota. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate biogas production by industrial wastes and to use the biofertilizer for the bioremediation of soils previously contaminated with gasoline. Biomass generated approximately 10L of methane and 3L of other gases. Anaerobic incubation reduced total and volatile solids, as well as biochemical oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand, and carbon and nitrogen contents of the biomass. The bioremediation experiment showed that 30 days after contamination of the soil, both contaminated soil (SC) and the contaminated soil with added biofertilizer (SBC) presented an equal reduction in theamount of aromatic hydrocarbons. Fifteen days after contamination, the addition of the biofertilizer improved the degradation efficiency of mono-aromatic hydrocarbons; however, the degradation of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons was less efficient. So, we conclude that the anaerobic incubation of industrial wastes generates a high amount of biogas, and biofertilizer disposal in contaminated soil does not affect the efficiency of the degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons after 30 days.'}; {'title': 'Yes Delft!

This service is powered by a simple but novel text classifier resistant to spelling errors, and now handles roughly 10% of all requests to the chatbot, doubling the click-through rate of the original service.- Working in a small team, we developed an unsupervised sentence representation, capable of introducing new topics into the chatbot without training data.

Since my school days, I have been passionate about helping businesses gain a competitive edge in the marketplace and increase profits through Big Data. Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to apply my technical know-how while working with industry leaders in technology, management, and finance. Though I have held leadership roles for years, I decided to enhance my business acumen further by pursuing my M.B.A. With a concentration in Marketing and Strategic Management, I earned my degree from Wharton School of Business. While I could write (another!) book on ways to use Big Data to spur bottom-line revenue, here are some of my favorites:COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATIONMany companies possess vast amounts of data on businesses and customers. By tapping into these insights and leveraging them strategically, I identify ways to differentiate services/products from competitors. PRODUCT DEVELOPMENTMuch of my career has involved conceptualizing ways data-related products can be monetized and guiding teams to build these products and services.TARGET MARKETINGBy using quantitative and qualitative market research to more narrowly target audiences, I work closely with marketing leaders to increase the ROI of sales and advertising campaigns. In addition, I collaborate with engineers to target customers with new products.Even though I am now a true business professional, I do have a background in academia. While working toward my Ph.D. and my Post-Doctoral Fellowship in Artificial Intelligence, I published academic papers, presented at international conferences, and taught programming and computing classes to undergraduate students. In fact, I earned a Wharton MBA Grant and Sainsbury Management Fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering due to my leadership background and stellar academic record.More than anything, I enjoy guiding organizations in optimizing ALL of their data. I truly find building new data-focused businesses fun!
