Currently I am working at Facebook to solve Data Science problems at scale! As a part of the Advanced Analytics & Modeling practice at Deloitte, I worked on projects for clients across different sectors like Insurance, Banking, Retail, Higher Education, etc. These projects typically used data and advanced analytics technologies to help clients make informed business decisions. The work helped organizations to better understand their customers and risks, spot anomalies, and tackle real-world problems.As a Data Science Intern at LinkedIn, my work largely involved doing exploratory data analysis that helped understand how the consumers are using the LinkedIn News Feed. My background in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at CMU has helped me hone my descriptive and predictive analytics skills. With courses like Experimental Design, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Advanced Business Analytics, I have built an expertise in analyzing and visualizing large datasets. My strong technical acumen was complemented by a course on Managing Analytics Projects, which helped me gain deeper insights into the specific issues any analytics project faces, and their solutions. The core strength of a Data Scientist is programming – something that my work experience at ThoughtWorks Technologies as a Senior Application Developer helped me excel at. A typical day for me involved interacting with clients and business analysts, analyzing and breaking down problems into user stories, estimation of stories, brainstorming and programming. Working on multiple projects allowed me to dabble with multiple technologies which in turn helped me build a critical skill – picking up new technologies quickly.

I’m excited about the new ways that Machine Learning is being used to solve big data problems.Much of my work has been about helping marketers use their data to understand their customers and optimize their marketing activities.  Specifically, I've done a lot of work with cross-channel marketing attribution, including cross-device attribution and attributing online activity to offline sales by matching user IDs across data sets.I've also done work to improve display advertising products, often by investigating issues and finding actionable insights hidden in hundreds of terabytes of raw log data.  I’ve worked in many areas of display advertising, including online auctions, Behavioral Targeting, user understanding, impression valuation, reach prediction, forecasting, campaign optimization, metrics, and experimentation. I like the problems in display advertising because we need to consider the needs of three stakeholders, the publisher, advertiser, and user.

As a consultant, I was able to work across many technologies and several different industries in both a technical and business capacity.   For my first assignment, I fulfilled the role of a data quality analyst for a global insurance company in Hartford, Connecticut.   I was responsible for creating and monitoring data quality reports, in order to execute data remediation solutions to improve the usability of the data.  Immediately following her role as a data quality analyst, I focused on delivering a Pega Customer Relationship Management solution for a regional health insurance provider in Detroit, Michigan.  As the integration and data architect, I designed the flow of data from several sources to populate the front end of the CRM screens as well as the communications that were required between Pega and the external integrated systems.  My final consulting engagement was working with a diversified multinational mass media corporation in Burbank, California to research the current state of the client’s data solutions across several business segments to create a unified data strategy as well as a roadmap to provide direction for the implementation of the new organizational strategy. While I gained valuable experience consulting, I was extremely excited to continue my academic journey by obtaining my Masters in Analytics from Northwestern University’s McCormick School of Engineering.  Throughout my master’s program, I refined my skills in statistical methods, computer science, data analysis, big data analytics, etc.  I now look forward to moving into the healthcare industry as a data scientist for New York Presbyterian.
