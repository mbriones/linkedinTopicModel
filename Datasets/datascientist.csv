Currently I am working at Facebook to solve Data Science problems at scale! As a part of the Advanced Analytics & Modeling practice at Deloitte, I worked on projects for clients across different sectors like Insurance, Banking, Retail, Higher Education, etc. These projects typically used data and advanced analytics technologies to help clients make informed business decisions. The work helped organizations to better understand their customers and risks, spot anomalies, and tackle real-world problems.As a Data Science Intern at LinkedIn, my work largely involved doing exploratory data analysis that helped understand how the consumers are using the LinkedIn News Feed. My background in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at CMU has helped me hone my descriptive and predictive analytics skills. With courses like Experimental Design, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Advanced Business Analytics, I have built an expertise in analyzing and visualizing large datasets. My strong technical acumen was complemented by a course on Managing Analytics Projects, which helped me gain deeper insights into the specific issues any analytics project faces, and their solutions. The core strength of a Data Scientist is programming – something that my work experience at ThoughtWorks Technologies as a Senior Application Developer helped me excel at. A typical day for me involved interacting with clients and business analysts, analyzing and breaking down problems into user stories, estimation of stories, brainstorming and programming. Working on multiple projects allowed me to dabble with multiple technologies which in turn helped me build a critical skill – picking up new technologies quickly.

During this period, I got an opportunity to encounter techniques like injection molding, punching, paper-coating and pleating and also saw the live application of poka-yoke, 5S principles and assembly line optimization. Along with this, I got to see in action a live example of the Hub-Spokes supply chain model. The next part of my tenure was spent in the Research and Development department, as a 3-D designer and materials engineer. Working on the platform UG NX 8.5, I designed Air, Oil and Fuel filters for automotive giants like Daimler, Volkswagen, and Honda.

During my subsequent three years in the industry, I worked on projects from diverse fields like supply chain optimization, marketing, insurance, and finance respectively, where I again leveraged data to assist decision making. My graduate studies are centered towards further building my capabilities in the field of data science and learning about the latest techniques in artificial intelligence like deep learning. The two most motivating factors for me in this area of study are:1. The versatility of skills. Each and every industry is experiencing data-driven innovation today and this is set to grow further - this includes societal causes like crime, hunger etc.2. The obsolescence of skills. Due to the fast pace at which the research is progressing in the field, one must always be up to date with the best and latest techniques to maximize impact. This brings along the promise and exciting challenge of perpetual learning.    Outside the data world, I enjoy hiking, reading, fine arts and everything basketball.

I've always loved puzzles and for me the puzzle pieces are data. I love collecting the data, sorting through and connecting the data, and finally constructing a model out of that data to be used for solving the problem at hand. Data science has given me the framework to pragmatically apply my math and science skills to puzzles in a wide range of fields. Whether it's marketing models or semi-conductor research, there is data and there is the potential to use that data for overcoming obstacles. It’s always been about the data. In the past I’ve worked as a scientist and engineer to solve problems mostly at the lab bench, but the experiments and solutions have always been driven by data. I used data to define the problem, form a hypothesis, and design the experiments. Then the data collected from the experiments was used to build a model, make predictions, and inspire future experiments. While I loved my time in the lab, I've recently decided to apply my efforts towards larger puzzles found in Data Science. Beyond on data, exceptional communication is a strength of mine. After earning my Masters Degree, I taught community college algebra because I enjoy helping students understand something they previously thought was beyond their grasp. I'm a firm believer of knowing complex ideas deep enough to be able to explain them to both technical and non-technical audiences. Teaching also turned out to be a great way to enhance my listening skills. Hearing and really understanding what students are confused about and what they are asking you to explain further takes patience and receptiveness.My path into data science has been winding, mostly due to following my husband for his career and taking a moment to stay home with my kids, but now that we've settled in Colorado I have the freedom to take my career towards doing what I love -- solving data puzzles. www.jaclynkokx.com

I enjoy research in Deep Learning, ML, NLP. As a Data Scientist at Cisco Systems Inc., I'm working to advance Cisco's efforts in Dl/ML/AI. Previously, I have had the opportunity to work with some very cool and accomplished people. I spent the summer of 2016 at Adobe Research where I worked with Trung Bui, Walter Chang and Hung Bui on extracting the correct reading order text. Our RNN based approach landed us with two US patents. At Purdue as part of my graduate research, I worked on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition. Our work was appreciated in the form of a paper in CoNLL Shared Task 2016. While at Purdue, I also got a chance to work on detecting direct perception in Autonomous driven cars using Deep Learning techniques. Before this, I completed my Undergraduate Thesis at Northwestern University as a Research Intern at the Center for Ultra-Scale Computing and Information Security. I also had the pleasure of working with the very awesome Yves Xie on exploring the power of RNNs. Our paper was accepted at the Association of Computation Linguistics (ACL) 2015 Main Conference. I've also worked remotely with Dr. Irina Rish from IBM Research on exploring deep learning applications to fMRI. I owe it to Prof. Russ Greiner for introducing me to things ML is capable of achieving. My interest in this area grew exponentially while working with him on Intelligent Diabetes Management as a Mitacs Globalink Research intern at University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada. I am also a hackathon junkie and love to build new things from scratch. You can check them out at http://devpost.com/pranjaldaga .

The three key areas are as follows:• Mobile Health. I proposed and conducted a novel study on how to monitor basic sleep behavior and how to detect irregular sleep nights, through unconstrained smartphone sensing. This is the first work that uses unconstrained smartphone sensing to detect sleep pattern changes with the benefits of reduced training efforts and improved robustness against behavior diversity. I also proposed a continuous place and motion state tracking framework that was proved to use 58% less energy than previous work and provide a much faster place entrance detection approach. • Predicting mobile application usage. I built an innovative on-board service that could accurately predict which App the user is likely to open next. On top of the prediction service, I also built an intelligent launcher that surfaces the icons of those Apps that are likely to be used to the front screen so the user can quickly find what he/she wants. This personalized intelligent app launcher system can even pre-load the App into the memory for faster execution. • Usability testing of mobile apps. We proposed a toolkit that embeds into mobile applications the ability to automatically collect user interface (UI) events as the user interacts with the applications. We have implemented the toolkit on Android devices and we evaluated the toolkit with a real deployed Android application by comparing event analysis (state-machine based) with traditional laboratory testing (expert based). The results show that our toolkit is effective at capturing detailed UI events for accurate usability analysis.'}; {'title': 'Predictive Modeling Intern', 'company': 'Plymouth Rock Assurance', 'date_range': 'Jun 2014 – Aug 2014', 'location': 'Boston', 'description': 'Analyze usage-based insurance (UBI) data collected from UBI devices and model driver’s driving behavior.'}; {'title': 'Summer Intern', 'company': 'EMC', 'date_range': 'Jun 2013 – Aug 2013', 'location': 'Franklin, MA', 'description': 'Develop virtual Lab environment using Hadoop and No-SQL tools.

I enjoyed the challenge of math problem solving and discovered that I have a real aptitude for math modeling and data analysis.  As an undergraduate, I took part in two mathematical modeling contests where I was awarded a Meritorious Winner in Mathematical Modeling in one competition and a Second Prize award in the other.To gain practical experience, I worked as a data analyst intern at Boss ZhiPin, a company that designs mobile software.  I applied regression methods along with clustering algorithms to classify and analyze customers’ engagement from a dataset of over 10 million entries. Then my team used the results to develop precision marketing strategies which increased customer retention rate by 16%. Through this internship, I also mastered the skills of Python and R.My undergraduate research thesis on network traffic anomaly detection furthered my interest and skills in analyzing large datasets and machine learning.  To reduce the false negative rate, I developed a new multi-model approach for detecting network traffic anomalies which employ k-means clustering, decision tree and random forest algorithms in an experimental simulation. My paper describing this project was accepted by the International Journal of Computers Communications & Control and I patented the new model at State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R. China.These experiences were thrilling for me. I gained tremendous satisfaction and enjoyment while learning more about big data analysis and machine learning algorithms. I am now pursuing a master’s degree in finical statistics and risk management to extend further my programming and mathematical skills applied to real problems.

My mom likes to tell the story of when I was a child, and decided to see what happened when dropping an egg on the kitchen floor. I opened the fridge and released the first one, and after it inevitably broke, I grabbed and dropped another one (one data point, after all, is not enough to form a conclusion). As an adult, I prefer to collect and examine data to create value for businesses, rather than to create a yolky mess on the floor. Approaching college graduation, I wasn’t exactly sure what to do with a degree in math and physics. After stumbling into an internship in a new field (at the time) called “data science”, it was fulfilling to realize I love using my skills not only to uncover secrets in often messy, confusing piles of data, but to use that knowledge to shape how businesses run. Since then, I have spent the last four years learning and growing as a data scientist, expanding my technical repertoire to include Python, R and SQL, and applying my skills across a variety of industries.Looking forward, I hope my career continues to be filled with challenges and opportunities to learn and to lead. Currently, I am pursuing a second B.S. in Computer Science while progressing in my career, in order to become a better-rounded data scientist and multi-disciplinary leader. I am excited to apply those skills on the Communications team at Google.

I am proud to say that I have inspired many young women to start a career in STEM. I am also a sought-after consultant and have advised countless companies on how to establish a winning data strategy, and how to avoid the common pitfalls when building a data function. I am able to instill a data-centric mindset in even the most skeptical environments.As a people manager, I believe first and foremost that the best leaders should remain hands-on in order to be able to jump in when needed, and to fully understand the challenges of their team members. I strongly oppose micro-management and believe in empowerment through trust and partnership.

Derived information will be critical for autonomous cars which will be soon dominant on the road in the very near future. I was also involved in predictive analytics team where I tried to predict future traffic patterns using historical data. In this role, I have tried many different machine learning algorithms including decision tree, k-means clustering, naive bayesians, neural network, support vector mahcine, k-nearest neighbor, etc. From the experience in HERE, Nokia, I have aquired extensive python analysis skills as well as R, Hadoop, Netezza skills.In my previous job as a researcher in Physics Department at Carnegie Mellon University and also a member of  CMS experiment, I analyzed data collected from a particle accelerator located at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland resulting in discovery of a new boson called Higgs. I tried to find hyperthetical particles based on Super Symmetry theory. Research was published in well recognized journal in particle physics fields. I have also developed a fast simulation software, called Gflash. It is a parameterized detector simulation replacing parts of full Geant4 simulation resulting in performance gains without sacrifying accuracy. I also developed GPU capable simulation softwares describing electromagnetic interactions based on Geant4.I was involved in many other analyses in my physics career which led me to aquire many skills including statistical data analysis as well as computer programming. I am quite experienced in C++, Java, Python, Shell Scripts, ROOT, Javascripts, PHP, Fortran. I am also knowledgeable of linux admins including Apache configuration, MySQL, CVS, SVN, ELOG server configurations in redhat families.

We are being the first to introduce an early-time online user or topic recommender framework during urgent events, which is well compatible with Twitter streaming API. The follows are several aspects:  Utilize Twitter API to extract stream tweets from specified users or with specified terms; construct retweet networks using regular expression; track event diffusion and conversation evolution on Twitter by studying and visualizing network statistics.  Use empirical metrics to quantify influential users during events diffusion process, perform online early prediction on future user influence using network features with different methods: LASSO generalized linear model (GLM), decision tree, deep learning and support vector machine (SVM). With addition of new features, achieve an average of 20% improvement on prediction performance against the benchmark design.  Identify sub-topics from urgent events using hashtags or classical topic models--latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), predict topic future popularity with current information using machine learning methods. Construct topic monitoring system from it. Apart from the above major research projects, I also did a number of small data science projects: • Lyft travel time duration prediction with temporal geographical features using random forest• Stocktwits messages recommendation prediction using word vectors and other content features in Spark framework.• StackExchange topic classification on discussions using word embedding trained by RNN (recurrent neural network)• Comprehensive study of travel distance, tips and speed distribution using TLC taxi data.• Perform multiclass classification on customer age groups using various mobile behavior features.• Spotify user listening behavior analysis using clustering methods.• Facebook app user adoption prediction using logistic regression.'}; {'title': 'Machine Learning Scientist intern', 'company': 'Amazon', 'date_range': 'Jun 2015 – Aug 2015', 'location': 'Greater Seattle Area', 'description': ""I have done two projects as a machine learning scientist intern at at Amazon CSA (customer service applications): 1.

Finished my Bachelor's in Mathematics & Economics in 2016 and have completed one Udacity Nanodegree every year since. Born in Guangzhou and educated across Toronto, San Diego, and London. Love traveling, creating, competing, and reading.Currently building one of the most exciting products in AdTech as a Data Scientist at CAKE. I genuinely believe I have the greatest job in the world. The math is fascinating, the programming is rewarding, and the industry research always makes you feel like an expert (if only temporarily) when you're done.In my free time I like to travel to foreign countries and do things that make for great stories later. Having recently moved to Newport Beach, I've also started dabbling in Kick Boxing, CrossFit, and Spartan Races, all of which have embarrassed me greatly, but also pushed me to new heights. My present after-hours goals are finishing Udacity's Artificial Intelligence (my third) Nanodegree and building my out-of-office engineering portfolio.Technical Competencies:Scala, Python, R, Apache Spark, TensorFlow, AWS

During my time at E8 Security, I designed (full architecture) and built (full coding) an in-production scalable machine learning framework using Python/Spark/HDFS/HBase leveraging security logs from endpoint(CrowdStrike, Tanium, and Carbon Black), web proxy, network, VPN, and various third-party feeds (malware, geolocation.. etc). This framework stages includes standardization of input data into a set of predefined MEF formats, integrate with the user and host entities, configurable feature extraction engine, automated modeling engine and scoring engines. The modeling engine encapsulates three main modeling areas: (1) newly observed, (2) behavioral change, and (3) anomaly detection. Each modeling area consists of a set of machine learning techniques. These techniques include Isolation Forest, time series predictive analytics, Single class SVM, KMeans, and a few more proprietary techniques. This framework enables both data scientists (including me) to build new use cases for threat and anomaly detection, modeling behavioral change for the identified entities (user and hosts). The development stack I currently work on includes: Python, Scala, Java, Pig (legacy), Spark, Hive, Hadoop, HDFS, HBase, Impala, Phoenix, Github, AWS, Azkaban, Arcadia (Visualization), MEF, Parquet, and Avro.

I'm both an experienced Data Scientist and Educator.  Previously, I was a Data Scientist on the Quantitative Research and Analytics team at Allstate Insurance Company for 4 years, where I tackled a variety of problems, such as fraud modeling, cross-sell prediction, pricing, agent placement optimization, and telematics algorithm creation.  As an Educator, I was a Data Science Lead Instructor, Director of Data Science, and VP of Educational Design at Galvanize.  I am results-driven, focused, energetic, creative, and a good communicator (all that teaching definitely helped).   Having studied statistics and business and holding mostly quantitative jobs since I was 18, analytics is deep in my bones, deep in my wiring.  I believe that my analytical thinking, creativity, business sense, drive for results, and leadership skills can help companies become more *data-driven*.   Presently, I am doing lots of self-studying, serving as a data science mentor with Springboard, and working with Enki.com on data curriculum and education analytics.  After thinking a ton about education in data science and software development for the past 3 years at Galvanize, it's really refreshing to be on these other sides! In the meantime, I am open to pursuing roles in Data Science and you can contact me at tammyclee@gmail.com

I was involved with experimental operations and analysis of data sets at many levels. I worked with petabyte scale data sets, engineered data pipelines, and carried out analyses in an international collaboration.I applied machine learning techniques in conjunction with custom designed hardware to categorize rare particle events, in order to separate these rare events from a high noise background. I was involved with all stages of design, construction, testing and operation of a resistive plate chamber hardware upgrade to the experiment over seven years. This included hands on hardware and electronics work, software development and operation for data acquisition and quality assurance analysis. And finally, I built code for the physics analysis of the data from the 2013 Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider run. This required large scale processing of data via a condor cluster and C++ implementation of machine learning and statistical techniques to extract the rare signal events. The physics goal of my research was to better understand the Quantum Chromodynamic origin of the proton spin. I studied the fraction of total proton spin contributed by sea-quarks via colliding polarized protons at 510 GeV center of mass energy in the electroweak decay channel. I studied the W boson decay produced in these collisions, to gain direct access to the helicity distribution sea-quarks, which in turn, provided a window into anti-quark contribution to proton spin.'}; {'title': 'Fellow', 'company': 'Insight Data Science', 'date_range': 'Sep 2015 – Dec 2015', 'location': 'Greater New York City Area', 'description': 'I built www.forecastmy.city - a data product that allows users to make an educated choice about where to live based on economic growth.
