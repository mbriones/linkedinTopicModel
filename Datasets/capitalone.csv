Currently I am working at Facebook to solve Data Science problems at scale! As a part of the Advanced Analytics & Modeling practice at Deloitte, I worked on projects for clients across different sectors like Insurance, Banking, Retail, Higher Education, etc. These projects typically used data and advanced analytics technologies to help clients make informed business decisions. The work helped organizations to better understand their customers and risks, spot anomalies, and tackle real-world problems.As a Data Science Intern at LinkedIn, my work largely involved doing exploratory data analysis that helped understand how the consumers are using the LinkedIn News Feed. My background in Business Intelligence and Data Analytics at CMU has helped me hone my descriptive and predictive analytics skills. With courses like Experimental Design, Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Mining and Advanced Business Analytics, I have built an expertise in analyzing and visualizing large datasets. My strong technical acumen was complemented by a course on Managing Analytics Projects, which helped me gain deeper insights into the specific issues any analytics project faces, and their solutions. The core strength of a Data Scientist is programming – something that my work experience at ThoughtWorks Technologies as a Senior Application Developer helped me excel at. A typical day for me involved interacting with clients and business analysts, analyzing and breaking down problems into user stories, estimation of stories, brainstorming and programming. Working on multiple projects allowed me to dabble with multiple technologies which in turn helped me build a critical skill – picking up new technologies quickly.

These values, beliefs, and attitudes are the main product of the company, and used for precise consumer targeting. As a member of a research team of 4 PhD scientists, I am responsible for the entire KDD process of all ~4K online behavior data models.Using advanced data preparation procedures and stochastic machine learning (ML) methods, I was able to reduce a typical model training time by 2000 times with the same level of precision. Consequently, with such fast training time, we were able to run more experiments, optimize model parameters, and achieve a higher model quality.I also developed an internal Model Management System that keeps track of a model’s parameters, Machine Learning algorithm used to build the model, its validation results, and other useful meta-data.Key technical challenges: high dimensional, sparse, and large volume data, relevant feature selection, incomplete and noisy data, multiple classes with imbalanced class distribution, high precision predictions.""}; {'title': 'Research assistant', 'company': 'University of Louisville', 'date_range': 'Sep 2009 – Dec 2013', 'location': None, 'description': 'I proposed an Inter-Domain Supervision (IDS) clustering framework to discover clusters within diverse data formats, mixed-type attributes and different sources of data.

I have extensive experience using open-source software and services for processing and analyzing big data (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, EC2, S3, etc.) I have solid algorithms knowledge, am a proponent and practitioner of clean code, and use default terminal colors that might make your eyes bleed.I study the practice and theory of machine learning in my free time. I've built an ensemble of Markov Chain models on MIDI note sequences to generate interpolated music, trained a class-weighted SVM to determine whether a given band will perform at a given music festival, and experimented with a variety of deep learning architectures for an array of different classification tasks. Before I made my foray into data science, I worked in education for a number of years, teaching high school mathematics and computer science in Boston and New York. As a result, I have a deep understanding of how to convey technical ideas to a largely non-technical crowd. I'm comfortable communicating with people from all backgrounds and I have a knack for pulling out the most important points from a given analysis.

As a product manager, I worked closely with my team of developers to cultivate a functional understanding of the technology we built so to better represent the customer.

Lots of them. Being on the customer's side means that we were usually aligned with the spirit of regulation, but respecting the letter of laws like the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) meant spending quality time with legal experts to learn the details.Influence and teamwork: Weaving together the technology and customer experience of otherwise separate businesses meant that I was constantly seeking common ground and compromise with partners across the enterprise.

Knowing they saw the most people and the most affluent clients of the bank loved them they were key to my success as a banker. Since then I've been confident that through spending time in finding out what's important to people, what inspires them and seeing exactly how they learned best is critical to leadership. I take it upon myself to educate associates in ways they understand, I challenge them by giving them goals that I know would push them to try harder, we celebrate every small victory and learned from every opportunity. What gives me the most joy is seeing the impact I can make on an individual's life. Seeing them do things and reach milestones they never had before due to the work we put in together gives me great joy. In 2013 I was hired by Capital One Bank as a Multi Branch Banker where I was responsible for working closely with Branch Managers within a cluster to motivate and inspire teams to execute on the bank mission ""Changing Banking For Good"". I spent a year in the position and absolutely loved it. I enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work in multiple different locations, coaching, developing and inspiring associates. Being able to get feedback from experienced managers on how to handle different situations and understanding different approaches to motivating people was invaluable. In 2014 I was promoted to Branch Manager and I have loved everyday of it! My favorite things about being a manager is seeing how much of an impact I can make on my associates careers and personal development. I truly believe you don't build a business, you build the people to build the business! I'm truly fortunate to be in a position doing what I love.
