stochastic programming e consider problems where uncertain variables follow distributions that are also unknown he method attempts to balance the goals of providing a solution that is robust to this distributional ambiguity and effectively leveraging historical data s in classic distributionally robust optimization  we hedge against distributional ambiguity by optimizing over a worse case distribution that satisfies some constraints owever  instead of using estimates for the moments  we partition the region and estimate conditional moments from historical data in order to derive constraints hus we restrict the class of distributions and therefore reduce conservativeness while retaining the advantage over a stochastic program of allowing for distributional ambiguity s we increase the number of regions in the partition  we include more specific problem data but also have greater estimation errors e derive a general formulation and demonstrate the computational tractability of the univariate case n the multivariate case  we explore polygonal and combinations of ellipsoids and differences of ellipsoids partitions e explore and derive formulations for two major applications  the newsvendor problem and facility location e perform numerical experiments to evaluate the practical usefulness of conditional moments as compared to full moments and a

2016  working with a research group studying spin physics at the University of California Riverside for Dr en Barish in collaboration with the PHENIX experiment at Brookhaven National Lab  was involved with experimental operations and analysis of data sets at many levels  worked with petabyte scale data sets  engineered data pipelines  and carried out analyses in an international collaboration applied machine learning techniques in conjunction with custom designed hardware to categorize rare particle events  in order to separate these rare events from a high noise background  collaborated with a global team of researchers to construct and troubleshoot resistive plate chambers  which were integrated into the PHENIX detector in 2012  developed and maintained software responsible for the fast production of physics data from raw data using a condor cluster during the subsequent 2012 and 2013 physics data periods at PHENIX using the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider  identified and patched several software performance bottlenecks as part of this work  also engineered the software systems responsible for monitoring the proton spin polarization of our colliding beams   a task which was crucial to maintaining data usability and quality  thesis research focused on understanding the Quantum Chromodynamic origin of the proton spin  studied the fraction of total proton spin contributed by sea quarks via colliding polarized protons at 510 GeV center of mass energy in the electroweak decay channel  studied the W boson decay produced in these collisions  to gain direct access to the helicity distribution sea quarks  which in turn  provided a window into anti quark contribution to proton spin facilitated the extraction of this result from the 2013 data set

demonstrated that the confidence of these classifiers could be used to enhanced the clinical safety of the device  Demonstrated that a source of secondary labels could be used to quickly expand our training sets  by identifying unlabelled training examples relevant to topics poorly represented in our labelled dataset Proposed a new micro service for information retrieval  which is able to provide concise and relevant answers to user queries about hundreds of common medical topics his service is powered by a simple but novel text classifier resistant to spelling errors  and now handles roughly 10% of all requests to the chatbot  doubling the click through rate of the original service Working in a small team  we developed an unsupervised sentence representation  capable of introducing new topics into the chatbot without training data  demonstrated how missing topics could be identified directly from previous user inputs  and how new content could be added into the system without risking the introduction of unintended bugs his new service is scheduled for deployment later this year Lead a research project into bilingual word vector representations  leading to a

services products from competitors RODUCT DEVELOPMENTMuch of my career has involved conceptualizing ways data related products can be monetized and guiding teams to build these products and services RGET MARKETINGBy using quantitative and qualitative market research to more narrowly target audiences  I work closely with marketing leaders to increase the ROI of sales and advertising campaigns n addition  I collaborate with engineers to target customers with new products en though I am now a true business professional  I do have a background in academia hile working toward my Ph  and my Post Doctoral Fellowship in Artificial Intelligence  I published academic papers  presented at international conferences  and taught programming and computing classes to undergraduate students n fact  I earned a Wharton MBA Grant and Sainsbury Management Fellowship from the Royal Academy of Engineering due to my leadership background and stellar academic record re than anything  I enjoy guiding organizations in optimizing ALL of their data  truly find building new data focused businesses fun    ,{ title    Volunteer    company    Northwest Harvest    date range    Oct 2015 – Oct 2015
